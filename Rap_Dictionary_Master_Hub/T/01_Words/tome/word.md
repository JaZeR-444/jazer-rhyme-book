# WORD: Tome

## Meaning (plain):
A large, heavy, or scholarly book; a volume that forms part of a larger work.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "heavy" collection of hits or a massive amount of street knowledge. Represents a career so long and deep that it takes up a whole "volume" in the history of the game. When you drop a "tome," you're releasing a masterpiece that is too heavy for the common fakes to carry.
