# WORD: Industry

## Meaning (plain):
Economic activity concerned with the processing of raw materials and manufacture of goods in factories; a particular branch of economic or commercial activity.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The massive, profit-driven "machine" of the game. Represents the corporate side of rap—the labels, the factories of hits, and the commercial processing of talent. To be "in the industry" means you are navigating the big leagues of business and production.
