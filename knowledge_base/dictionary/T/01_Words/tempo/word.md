# WORD: Tempo

## Meaning (plain):
In music, the rate of speed of a piece or passage; the rate of motion or activity; pace.

Metaphor for commanding the "momentum" of the game. Having "tempo" means you control the speed of the conversation—whether you're slowing it down for emphasis or speeding it up to overwhelm. You dictate the pace at which the culture moves.
