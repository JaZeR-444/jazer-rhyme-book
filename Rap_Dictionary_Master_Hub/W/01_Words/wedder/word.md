# WORD: Wedder

## Meaning (plain):
1. A person who marries. 2. (Obsolete/Regional) An alternative form of "wether," a castrated buck goat or ram. 3. A wagerer or gambler.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for someone who has "married" the game or a rival who is "neutered" and powerless. Represents someone who committed to the hustle for life, but also used as an insult for a rival who lacks the "horns" or the virility of a real hitter—someone who is just a "wedder" following the herd.
