# WORD: NCAA

## Meaning (plain):
The National Collegiate Athletic Association; an organization that regulates student athletics among about 1,100 schools in the US and Canada.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "hungry" amateur stage of the game. Being "NCAA" means you're still in the feeder system—playing for the love of the game and working your way toward that pro contract. A state of high-potential, collegiate-level grinding.
