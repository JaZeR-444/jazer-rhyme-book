# WORD: Trophy

## Meaning (plain):
Something gained or given in victory or conquest; a prize in a competition; a symbol of success used to enhance status.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the literal and metaphorical "accolades" of the game. Having a "trophy" means you've conquered a rival or a whole scene and have the prize to prove it. Represents the recognition, the plaques, and the status that you carry as a champion of the culture.
