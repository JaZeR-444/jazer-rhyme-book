# WORD: Lacquer

## Meaning (plain):
A hard, glossy, and often transparent coating applied to wood or metal, which dries by solvent evaporation to form a protective finish.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "polished" or high-shine exterior that is also extremely hard and protective. Represents a flow or persona that has been finished to perfection—shiny on the surface but tough as a shell.
