# WORD: Posing

## Meaning (plain):
Assuming a particular position in order to be photographed or painted; presenting oneself in a deceptive or artificial way.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate term for "faking it." Represents someone who acts like an OG or a heavy hitter but is actually just putting on a show for the cameras. Posing means your street cred is artificial—you look the part but can't back it up with real action.
