# WORD: Omega

## Meaning (plain):
The 24th and last letter of the Greek alphabet; the extreme or last part of something; the final word.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being the "final word" in the game or the ultimate end-point of success. Being the "Omega" means you're the last man standing—the one who finishes the story and closes the book on the competition. A status of total, final dominance.
