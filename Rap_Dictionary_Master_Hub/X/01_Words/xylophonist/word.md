# WORD: Xylophonist

## Meaning (plain):
A person who plays the xylophone, a musical instrument consisting of a series of wooden bars struck with mallets.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "rhythmic master" who knows how to strike the right "bars" to get a reaction. Being a "xylophonist" means your flow is percussive, wooden (grounded), and perfectly timed. Represents someone who "plays" the industry like a high-end instrument.
