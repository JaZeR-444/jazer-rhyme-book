# WORD: Medieval

## Meaning (plain):
Relating to the Middle Ages (roughly 5th-15th century AD); (informal) very old, outmoded, or primitive in a brutal way.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for an "old-school" or primitive brutality. Represents someone who brings an ancient, unrefined, and perhaps "torturous" intensity to the game—going back to the dark ages to settle a score. A move that is both historical and devastating.
