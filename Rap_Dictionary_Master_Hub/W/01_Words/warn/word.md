# WORD: Warn

## Meaning (plain):
To notify someone about potential danger, impending trouble, or possible harm; to advise caution or admonish about conduct.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for giving the competition their "final notice." When you warn someone in the game, you're telling them that the heavy heat is coming and they need to clear the way or face the consequences. Represents a status of superior power where you don't need to strike immediately—you just give the warning and watch them move.
