# WORD: Net

## Meaning (plain):
1. An open-meshed fabric of cord or wire for catching things. 2. (Adjective) An amount remaining after all deductions or charges (net profit). 3. To gain as a clear profit.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "pure win." Having a "net" gain means you've cleared all the expenses and the fakes, and you're left with the solid, undiluted profit of your hustle. Also refers to "catching" opportunities like a fisherman in the deep sea of the industry.
