# WORD: Prohibits

## Meaning (plain):
Formally forbids something by law, rule, or other authority; prevents or makes impossible.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "gatekeeping" rules of the game. Represents the status or the standards that "prohibit" the fakes and the outsiders from entering your lane. When your level is too high, it naturally prohibits the low-quality from competing.
