# WORD: Zeolites

## Meaning (plain):
A family of microporous, crystalline aluminosilicate minerals used as adsorbents and catalysts; known for their ability to filter and exchange ions.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Representing a "filtering" process (keeping it real, removing the fake), being a "catalyst" for change, or having a complex, porous structure.

## Syllables:
3 (ze-o-lites)

## Part of speech:
Noun (Plural)

## Synonyms:
minerals, adsorbents, catalysts, aluminosilicates

## Antonyms:

## Rhyme ideas (end / slant / multi):
END: lights, heights, nights, bites / SLANT: satellites, parasites / MULTI: Zeolites in the rock, stop the clock, on the block

## 3 bar-ready examples:
1. Filtering the fakes out, call us Zeolites.
2. Catalyst for the culture, like Zeolites.
3. Microporous flow, deep like Zeolites.

## 3 punchline angles:
1. "Filtering" (removing negative/fake elements)
2. "Catalyst" (accelerating success/change)
3. Scientific "Crystalline" value
