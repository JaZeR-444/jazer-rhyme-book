(Slang) Nothing; zero; a total absence of something.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate term for "nothing at all." Used to describe a rival who has "zilch" street cred or a track that has "zilch" heat. It's a sharp, slang-based way to dismiss someone as having no value or impact in the game.
