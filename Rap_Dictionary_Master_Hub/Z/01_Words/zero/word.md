# WORD: Zero

## Meaning (plain):
The number 0; the absence of quantity or magnitude; nothing; the lowest point on a scale.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for starting from the "absolute bottom" or for a rival who has "nothing" to offer. Being a "zero" in the game means you have no weight and no impact. Also represents the "count" before the strike—starting from zero and building a kingdom.
