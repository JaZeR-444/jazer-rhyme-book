# WORD: Overcast

## Meaning (plain):
Covered or overspread with clouds; cloudy, dark, or gloomy; (meteorology) more than 95% of the sky is covered.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "dark" and all-encompassing energy. Represents someone whose sound covers the whole scene like a storm—gloomy, heavy, and ready to drop "rain" (bars) at any moment. A state where your presence blocks out the light of others.
