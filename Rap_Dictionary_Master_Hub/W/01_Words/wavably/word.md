## Meaning (plain):
Capable of being waived or relinquished; able to be moved back and forth in a wave-like motion (fluidly).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "fluid and adjustable" flow. Being "wavably" means your rhythm can move back and forth between styles without losing its strength—it's a wave-like energy that adapts to the track. Also refers to being able to "waive" or drop certain street rules for a strategic advantage.
