# WORD: Occulted

## Meaning (plain):
Hidden from view; (astronomy) when one celestial body is hidden by another passing in front of it (an eclipse).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "hidden power" or a talent that was eclipsed by others but is now coming out of the shadows. Represents someone who was overlooked but was actually calculating their move in the dark. An occulted power is one that rivals never saw coming until it was too late.
