# WORD: Orf

## Meaning (plain):
1. (Biology) "Open Reading Frame," a segment of DNA with the potential to code for a protein. 2. A viral disease affecting sheep/goats (pox).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having a "segment" of raw potential that hasn't been coded yet. Represents someone who has the "blueprints" for a hit but is waiting for the right moment to "translate" it into reality. A status of untapped, biological-level talent.
