# WORD: Immunity

## Meaning (plain):
The ability of an organism to resist a particular infection or toxin; official exemption from a legal obligation or penalty.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "untouchable" in the game. Represents a status where you are resistant to the "toxic" energy of rivals and exempt from the usual "rules" that hold others back. Having immunity means the drama can't infect your career.
