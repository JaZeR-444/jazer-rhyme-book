# WORD: Bevatron

## Meaning (plain):
A former particle accelerator (a weak-focusing proton synchrotron) at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory that accelerated protons to energies of billions of electron-volts (GeV). It was used to discover the antiproton.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for massive, atomic-level energy and the ability to "accelerate" to a point of discovery. Represents a breakthrough force that operates at a scale others can't even perceive.

## Syllables:
3 (bev-a-tron)

## Part of speech:
noun

## Synonyms:
accelerator, synchrotron, power-source, collider

## Antonyms:
N/A

## Rhyme ideas (end / slant / multi):
END: on, dawn, gone / SLANT: pattern, saturn, marathon / MULTI: bevatron force, cosmic source, stay the course

## 3 bar-ready examples:
1. Accelerating particles, power of a bevatron.
2. Breakthrough energy, bevatron in the long run.
3. Billion-volt delivery, bevatron with the sun.

## 3 punchline angles:
1. Massive energy/scale (Billions of volts)
2. Scientific "breakthrough" or discovery (Antiproton link)
3. High-speed/atomic precision
