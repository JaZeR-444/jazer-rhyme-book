# WORD: Tiff

## Meaning (plain):
A minor, relatively unimportant argument or quarrel, often between friends or regarding petty matters; a slight fit of annoyance.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "petty beef." Represents a minor disagreement that doesn't deserve a full diss-track or real violence. When you have a "tiff" with a rival, it's just a small annoyance—something you brush off before getting back to the real money.
