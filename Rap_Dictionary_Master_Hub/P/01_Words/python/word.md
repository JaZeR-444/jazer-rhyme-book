# WORD: Python

## Meaning (plain):
1. A large, non-venomous snake that kills by constriction (strangling). 2. (Computing) A high-level, general-purpose programming language.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a flow that "constricts" and crushes the competition. Represents someone who wraps their bars around a rival and slowly squeeze the life out of their career. Also refers to high-level "coding" or technical skill in the writing—speaking a powerful, precise language.
