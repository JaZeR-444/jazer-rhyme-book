# WORD: Napa

## Meaning (plain):
1. A city and valley in California famous for wine production. 2. A type of Chinese cabbage (Napa cabbage). 3. (Native American) Disputed meanings including grizzly bear or house.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "vintage" success or high-end, bottled talent. Represents someone who brings the "flavor" of the valley—refined, aged to perfection, and highly valuable. Also refers to a "layered" complexity like the leaves of the cabbage.
