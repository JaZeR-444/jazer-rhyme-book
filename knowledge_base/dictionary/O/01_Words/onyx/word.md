# WORD: Onyx

## Meaning (plain):
A semi-precious variety of agate with different colors in parallel layers; most commonly refers to the solid black, polished variety.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "dark" and rare excellence. Represents someone who is solid black (stylishly dark), polished to perfection, and has a "gem-like" value that is both heavy and beautiful. Being "onyx" means you're rare, layered, and unshakeable.
