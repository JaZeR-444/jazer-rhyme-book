# WORD: Larvae

## Meaning (plain):
The immature, often wormlike feeding form of an insect that hatches from an egg and must undergo metamorphosis to become an adult.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "hungry" stage of a career before the total transformation. Represents someone who is still growing, feeding off the game, and preparing to "metamorphose" into a legendary force.
