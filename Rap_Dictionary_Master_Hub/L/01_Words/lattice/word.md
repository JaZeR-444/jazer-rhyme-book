# WORD: Lattice

## Meaning (plain):
A framework of crossed wood or metal strips, often forming a diagonal pattern with open spaces; a regular geometrical arrangement of points (as in a crystal).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "woven" or highly structured flow. Represents a complex arrangement of bars that has both "strength" (the strips) and "breathing room" (the open spaces). A geometric, crystalline precision in the writing.
