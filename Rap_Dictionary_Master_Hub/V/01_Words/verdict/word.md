# WORD: Verdict

## Meaning (plain):
A decision on a disputed issue in a civil or criminal case or an inquest; an opinion or judgment.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "final consensus" of the streets. When the "verdict" is in, it means the public and the legends have made their decision on your relevance. Represents the ultimate judgment that either crowns you as a winner or sentences you to obscurity.
