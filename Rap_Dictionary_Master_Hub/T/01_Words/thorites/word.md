# WORD: Thorites

## Meaning (plain):
Plural of thorite; a rare, radioactive mineral (thorium silicate) usually brown to black in color. It is the most common source of thorium.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "rare and radioactive" intensity. Represents someone whose energy is hazardous to the fakes—a heavy, mineral-like presence that glows with a dangerous, atomic-level power. A status that is both rare and capable of causing a "meltdown" in the competition.
