# WORD: Mammalian

## Meaning (plain):
Pertaining to or characteristic of mammals (vertebrates with hair, mammary glands, and three middle ear bones).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having a "warm-blooded" and essential foundation. Represents someone who is part of the "highest order" of the game—nurturing their own (mammary glands) but having the "ears" to hear the vibrations of the street before anyone else.
