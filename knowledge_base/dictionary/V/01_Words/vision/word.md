# WORD: Vision

## Meaning (plain):
The faculty or state of being able to see; a mental image of what the future could be like; a clear plan or aspiration.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having a "unique roadmap" to the top. Having "vision" means you can see the success before it happens—you see through the clouds of the industry and have a clear, forward-looking plan that no one else can see. A status of strategic and artistic clarity.
