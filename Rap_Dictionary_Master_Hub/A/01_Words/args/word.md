# WORD: Args

## Meaning (plain):
1. (Programming) Short for "arguments," the values passed into a function or procedure to control its behavior. 2. (Gaming) Short for "Alternate Reality Games," interactive narratives that use the real world as a platform.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "inputs" or variables that define a situation. Also refers to playing a "game" that blurs the line between fiction and reality—making the lifestyle real.
