To discuss formally with others to reach an agreement or settle terms (like a contract); to successfully get over or past a difficult obstacle or route.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "chess game" of the business and the streets. Represents the skill of handling contracts and beef without losing your advantage. Knowing how to "negotiate" means you can navigate difficult paths and come out with the best possible deal.
