# WORD: Naples

## Meaning (plain):
A major port city in southwestern Italy, the capital of Campania; originally from the Greek "Neapolis," meaning "new city."

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being a "major port" of the culture—a place where the talent and the "goods" flow in and out. Represents a massive, historic presence that is also constantly reinventing itself as a "new city." A status that is both ancient and fresh.
