# WORD: Lancelet

## Meaning (plain):
A small, fish-like marine animal (Amphioxus) that is a primitive relative of vertebrates, possessing a notochord but no backbone or braincase.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being a "primitive" or essential foundation of the game. Represents someone who has the "backbone" (notochord) of the culture but stays in the shadows (buried in sand). A raw, ancestral energy.
