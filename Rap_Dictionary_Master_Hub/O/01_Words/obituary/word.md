# WORD: Obituary

## Meaning (plain):
A notice of a death, especially in a newspaper, typically including a brief biography of the deceased person.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate metaphor for a "career-ending" track. When you write an "obituary" for a rival, you're not just dissing them—you're documenting the end of their relevance and summarizing their failure for the whole culture to see. A final, lyrical nails-in-the-coffin move.
