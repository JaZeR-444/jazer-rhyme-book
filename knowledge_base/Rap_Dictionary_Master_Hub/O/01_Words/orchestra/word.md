# WORD: Orchestra

## Meaning (plain):
A group of instrumentalists, especially one combining string, woodwind, brass, and percussion sections; a complex and coordinated ensemble.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "well-coordinated" and high-level movement. Being the "orchestra" means your whole team and your whole sound are working in perfect harmony—multiple sections (bars, beats, business, hype) coming together to create a massive, symphonic impact.
