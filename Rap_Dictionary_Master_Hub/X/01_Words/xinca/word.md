# WORD: Xinca

## Meaning (plain):
A non-Mayan indigenous people of Mesoamerica (Guatemala/El Salvador); refers to their language, which is considered a language isolate (unrelated to others).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being a "lyrical isolate." Represents someone whose sound is ancient, indigenous, and completely unrelated to the common trends. Being "Xinca" means your roots are deep and your language is unique—no one can trace your flow because it belongs only to you.
