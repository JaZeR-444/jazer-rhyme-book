# WORD: Lateral

## Meaning (plain):
Of, relating to, or situated at the side; extending to the side or moving to the side; (anatomy) away from the midline of the body.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for moving in a "different lane" or avoiding the direct, mainstream path. Having a "lateral" flow means you're sidestepping the expected trends and finding success through a unique, parallel route. A move that is unexpected and "off-center."
