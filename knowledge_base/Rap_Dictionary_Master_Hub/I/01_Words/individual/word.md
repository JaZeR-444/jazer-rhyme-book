# WORD: Individual

## Meaning (plain):
A single human being as distinct from a group, class, or family; single or separate.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being a "one-of-a-kind" force. Represents someone who stands separate from the trends and the "group" energy of the mainstream. Being an individual means you own your own lane and can't be categorized with the rest.
