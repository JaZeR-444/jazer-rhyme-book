# WORD: Talent

## Meaning (plain):
A special, often innate, natural ability or aptitude to do something well, especially in creative, artistic, or athletic fields.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The raw "God-given" power that you're born with. Having "talent" means you don't have to try to be great—it's already in your DNA. It's the essential spark that makes your flow undeniable and sets you apart from those who just "practice" without having the natural gift.
