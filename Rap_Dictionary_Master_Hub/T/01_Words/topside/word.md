# WORD: Topside

## Meaning (plain):
1. The upper part of the outer surface of a ship's hull above the waterline. 2. (Slang) The highest level of authority or leadership.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being at the "highest level" of authority in the game. Being "topside" means you're in the command center—looking down on the waterline (the fakes) and directing the whole movement from the top deck. A status of absolute leadership.

## Syllables:
