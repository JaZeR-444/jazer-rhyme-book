# WORD: Nap

## Meaning (plain):
1. A short period of sleep, typically during the day. 2. The soft or fuzzy surface texture on certain fabrics or leathers. 3. A type of card game.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "rest before the hustle" or for catching the competition while they're sleeping. Also represents having a "soft" surface (the nap) that hides a durable, high-quality material underneath—a mix of aesthetic and strength.
