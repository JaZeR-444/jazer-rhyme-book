# WORD: ODBC

## Meaning (plain):
Stands for Open Database Connectivity; a standard application programming interface (API) for accessing database management systems regardless of database type.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being the "universal connector" of the game. Being "ODBC" means you can interface with any part of the scene—the underground, the industry, the street—and translate the "data" into a consistent flow of hits. A status of technical and social versatility.
