# WORD: Ophrys

## Meaning (plain):
A genus of terrestrial orchids (bee orchids) known for mimicking female insects in appearance and scent to attract male pollinators.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "deceptive" rival who mimics the real ones to get attention. Also represents using high-level camouflage or "bait" to trap an enemy—looking like something they desire (a win) but actually being a predator. A master of street mimicry.
