# WORD: Tefillin

## Meaning (plain):
Sets of small black leather boxes containing parchment scrolls inscribed with verses from the Torah, traditionally worn by Jewish males during morning prayers.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "bound" to ancient wisdom and having a sacred connection to the craft. Represents someone who wears their "scrolls" (bars) on their head and arm—carrying the weight of a legendary, historical text into every battle. A status of disciplined, religious-level dedication.
