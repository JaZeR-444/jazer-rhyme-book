# WORD: Veteran

## Meaning (plain):
A person who has had long experience in a particular field; a person who has served in the armed forces.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being an "unshakeable" force with years of street service. Being a "veteran" means you've seen every trend, fought every war, and still stand tall—carrying a status of extreme experience and respect that rookies can't match. An OG of the booth.
