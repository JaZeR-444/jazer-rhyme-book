# WORD: Layoffs

## Meaning (plain):
The temporary or permanent termination of employment for business reasons (like cost-cutting or restructuring); involuntary separation from a job.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "cleaning house" or cutting off the dead weight in the crew. When you announce "layoffs," it means you're firing everyone who isn't contributing or who is holding the movement back. A total restructure of the squad.
