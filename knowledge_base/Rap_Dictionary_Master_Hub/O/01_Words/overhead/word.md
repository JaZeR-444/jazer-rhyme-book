# WORD: Overhead

## Meaning (plain):
1. Operating, lying, or coming from above; aloft. 2. (Business) Ongoing expenses of operating a business not directly tied to production (rent, insurance).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "above the heads" of the fakes or for the literal "costs" of staying in the game. Represents an elite status that people have to "look up" to see. Also refers to the high price you pay (rent, taxes, loss) just to keep the machine running.
