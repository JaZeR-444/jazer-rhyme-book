# WORD: Oversight

## Meaning (plain):
1. A mistake made because someone fails to notice something. 2. The act of directing work; superintendence or supervision.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for exploiting a rival's "blind spot" or for being the one who oversees the whole movement. Having "oversight" means you're in the director's chair—monitoring every move while the competition makes the "mistake" of ignoring you.
