# WORD: Tresis

(Surgery) Perforation from without; the act of boring or piercing through an external surface.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "piercing through" a rival's defense from the outside. Represents a tactical strike that bores through the external hype and hits the core of the problem. A move that is surgical, precise, and capable of creating a "hole" in an enemy's status.
