## Meaning (plain):
Made from wood pulp shaped in a mold; (dated engineering) pertaining to the molding or shaping of wood-based materials.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "molded" or highly structured persona. Represents someone whose flow has been carefully shaped into a specific form—built from the raw "pulp" of the streets but refined and hardened in a high-end mold. A status of being shaped for success.
