# WORD: Official

## Meaning (plain):
Relating to an authority or public body and its duties, actions, and responsibilities; authorized or sanctioned by a proper authority.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having "real" status and the street's sanctioned authority. Being "official" means you're not a fake or a temporary trend—you have the seal of approval from the legends and the people. A status that is formally recognized and unshakeable.
