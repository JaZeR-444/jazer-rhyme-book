# WORD: Mandate

## Meaning (plain):
An official command or authorization to act in a particular way; the authority given by an electorate to its representative.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having the "sanctioned authority" to lead the culture. Represents someone who has been given the "green light" by the streets or the labels to make big moves. A mandate is an official "go ahead" from the powers that be.
