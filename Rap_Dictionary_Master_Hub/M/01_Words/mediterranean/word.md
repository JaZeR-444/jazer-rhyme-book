# WORD: Mediterranean

## Meaning (plain):
Relating to the Mediterranean Sea or the countries bordering it; literally "in the middle of the land."

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "warm" and broad coastal style. Represents someone who brings that specific sun-drenched, international vibe to the music—carrying the energy of multiple "shores" at once. A status that is both expansive and central.
