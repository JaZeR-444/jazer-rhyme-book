# WORD: Ozone

## Meaning (plain):
A naturally occurring molecule (O3) that forms a protective layer in the stratosphere; an unstable, poisonous allotrope of oxygen with a peculiar odor.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having a "protective barrier" that is also toxic to outsiders. Being the "ozone" means you're at a high altitude—shielding your crew from the "UV rays" (the hate) while carrying a pungent, unstable energy that poisons the fakes.
