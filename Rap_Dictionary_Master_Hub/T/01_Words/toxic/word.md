## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a flow that is so intense it's "lethal" or for an energy that destroys the competition from the inside out. Used to describe someone whose words are poison to fakes—harmful, aggressive, and capable of ending a career. A status of dangerous, high-intensity negativity toward the ops.
