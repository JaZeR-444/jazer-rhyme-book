# WORD: Impact

## Meaning (plain):
The action of one object coming forcibly into contact with another; a marked effect or influence.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the literal "force" of your presence. Having impact means your arrival changes the direction of the game—it's a collision between your talent and the industry that leaves a lasting mark. A heavy, undeniable influence.
