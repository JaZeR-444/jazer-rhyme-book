# WORD: Lysogeny

## Meaning (plain):
A type of viral reproduction where the viral genome integrates into the host's chromosome and replicates without immediately destroying the host (dormancy).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "dormant power" or for a takeover that happens from the inside out. Represents someone who integrates into the scene silently, replicates their influence, and is ready to "trigger" a total takeover at any moment.
