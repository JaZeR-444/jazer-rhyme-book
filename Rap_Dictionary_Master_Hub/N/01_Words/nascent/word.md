# WORD: Nascent

## Meaning (plain):
Just beginning to exist or recently formed; not yet fully developed; (chemistry) an atom or substance at the moment of its formation.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "fresh out of the lab" talent that is already showing massive potential. Represents the moment when a new flow is born and is at its most "reactive" and powerful stage. A nascent career is one that everyone is watching because it's just about to explode.
