# WORD: Obstacle

## Meaning (plain):
A thing that blocks one's way or prevents or hinders progress.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the industry barriers and rivals who try to stop the movement. Represents a test of strength—something put in your path specifically to be overcome. An obstacle isn't just a problem; it's a milestone that you have to "vault" or "smash" to reach the next level.
