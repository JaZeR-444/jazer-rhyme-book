# WORD: Tekya

## Meaning (plain):
(Variant of Tekiah) A single, long, unbroken blast sounded on the shofar (ram's horn) during Jewish rituals.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "long, unbroken" flow or a clear signal of war. Represents the moment when you drop a single, massive bar or track that sounds like a siren—calling your crew to action and signaling the end for the competition. A powerful, ritualistic blast.
