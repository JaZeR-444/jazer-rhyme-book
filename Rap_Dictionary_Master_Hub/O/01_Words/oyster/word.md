# WORD: Oyster

## Meaning (plain):
Any of various marine bivalve mollusks with a rough shell; regarded as a delicacy; certain types produce pearls.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "tough exterior" that hides a rare and valuable core. Being an "oyster" means you have a rough, unpolished street shell, but inside you're carrying a "pearl" of high-end talent or wealth. A status of hidden value.
