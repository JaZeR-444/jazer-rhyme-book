# WORD: Xanthous

## Meaning (plain):
Yellow or yellowish in color; (archaic) pertaining to people with yellowish, red, auburn, or brown hair.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "bright and distinct" energy that stands out from the gray. Being "xanthous" means your flow has a specific, high-visibility "tint" that radiates warmth or intensity—like a yellow flare in the dark streets. A status of being naturally "colored" with talent.
