# WORD: Boolean

## Meaning (plain):
A system of symbolic logic (Boolean logic) or a data type in computing that represents one of two possible values: true or false (1 or 0).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a binary, no-nonsense state of mind. Represents a world where there is no middle ground—only "real" (true) or "fake" (false). A calculated, logical way of separating the ones from the zeros.

## 3 bar-ready examples:
1. No middle ground, it's boolean—you real or you fake.
2. Binary logic, a boolean decision to make.
3. Ones and zeros, boolean in the wake.

## 3 punchline angles:
1. "Real vs. Fake" (True/False)
2. Logical/binary decision making
3. Calculated/digital precision (1s and 0s)
