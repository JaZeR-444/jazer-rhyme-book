# WORD: Twain

## Meaning (plain):
An archaic or literary word meaning two or a pair; often used in the phrase "never the twain shall meet" to describe things that are fundamentally different.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for two forces that are so different they can never reconcile. Represents the gap between the "real" and the "fake"—the twain that will never meet in the middle. Also refers to a powerful "pair" or duo that dominates the scene.
