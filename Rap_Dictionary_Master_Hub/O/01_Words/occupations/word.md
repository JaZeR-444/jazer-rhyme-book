# WORD: Occupations

## Meaning (plain):
1. A person's regular work or profession. 2. The activity of living in or using a place. 3. The military control of a territory.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "total takeover" of a territory or a lane. Having "occupations" means you don't just visit the scene—you live there and you control it with military-level precision. Also refers to the various daily hustles that define your professional status.
