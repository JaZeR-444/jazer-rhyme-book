# WORD: Layer

## Meaning (plain):
A thickness of material spread over a surface; a level of material distinct from those above or below it; a level within a system or concept.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for depth and complexity. Having "layers" means your bars and your persona have multiple levels of meaning—you can't understand the whole story from just one look. Represents a rich, multifaceted presence.
