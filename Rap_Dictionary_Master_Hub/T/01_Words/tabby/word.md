# WORD: Tabby

## Meaning (plain):
A domestic cat with a coat pattern distinguished by stripes, dots, or swirls, often featuring a distinctive "M" shape on the forehead.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "marked" for the crown (the M shape) or for having a complex, "patterned" flow. Represents someone who carries their identity on their face and whose sound is full of intricate stripes and dots—a natural, distinct street pattern.
