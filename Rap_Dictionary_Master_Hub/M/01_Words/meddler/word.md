# WORD: Meddler

A person who interferes officiously or annoyingly, often with things that are not their concern.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for an "annoying rival" or a prying outsider who won't stay out of your lane. Represents someone who tries to disrupt your hustle without having any real skin in the game—a "busybody" of the streets.
