# WORD: Transcend

## Meaning (plain):
To rise above or go beyond the limits of something; to exceed or surpass in excellence, extent, or degree.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "legendary" status that goes beyond the normal rules of rap. Being able to "transcend" means you've risen above the beef, the trends, and the industry limitations—reaching a higher level of excellence where you are no longer just a rapper, but a timeless force. A move of pure, elevated dominance.
