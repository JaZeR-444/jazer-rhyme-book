# WORD: Kashrut

## Meaning (plain):
The body of Jewish religious laws concerning the suitability of food, the fitness for use of ritual objects, and other requirements (Kosher laws).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having strictly "clean" and high-standard rules for the life. Represents someone who doesn't mix with the "unfit" and maintains a disciplined, sanctioned way of moving through the scene.
