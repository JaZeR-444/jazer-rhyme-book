# WORD: Weatings

## Meaning (plain):
(British) Middlings; a grade of coarse flour or meal, often used for animal feed.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "coarse and unrefined" grade of street talent. Used to describe a rival whose flow is "middling"—it's the rough, lower-tier material that feeds the fakes but lacks the high-end quality of the real stars. A status of being unpolished and basic.
