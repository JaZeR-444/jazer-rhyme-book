# WORD: Tailzied

## Meaning (plain):
(Scots Law) Pertaining to an entail; specifically a "tailzied fee," where property is settled on a series of heirs other than those who would inherit by law.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for an "unusual inheritance" of power or for having a status that rivals can't naturally reach. Represents someone who has "settled" their legacy on a specific chosen few—creating a path of success that ignores the standard "laws" of the industry. A hand-picked, elite lineage.
