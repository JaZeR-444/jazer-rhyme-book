# WORD: Torque

## Meaning (plain):
A force that produces or tends to produce rotation or torsion; a measure of the effectiveness of a force in causing rotation.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "rotational power" and momentum of your flow. Having "torque" means your bars don't just hit—they twist and turn the game, creating a massive, circular force that pulls everything into your orbit. A move of pure, mechanical-strength energy.
