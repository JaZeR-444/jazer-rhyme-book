# WORD: Gerridae

## Meaning (plain):
A family of insects (water striders) capable of walking or gliding on the surface of water due to surface tension and their hydrophobic legs.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "gliding" over the surface of the game without sinking. Represents the ability to move effortlessly through difficult or "fluid" situations by maintaining high-level control and "tension."
