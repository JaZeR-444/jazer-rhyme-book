# WORD: Targets

## Meaning (plain):
Objects aimed at in shooting practice; goals or objectives; people or things that are the aim of an attack or criticism.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the rivals and the goals you have in your sights. Having "targets" means you aren't just firing blindly—you have a specific aim for every bar and every tactical move. If you're on someone's "target" list, you're the aim of a lethal lyrical attack.
