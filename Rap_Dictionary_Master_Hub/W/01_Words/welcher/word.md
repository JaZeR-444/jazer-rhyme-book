# WORD: Welcher

## Meaning (plain):
(Informal) Someone who swindles others by failing to repay a debt or honor a wager/bet.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate term for someone who doesn't "keep it real" with their word. Represents a fake who makes promises or bets they can't back up—a swindler of the streets who loses their credit the moment they fail to pay the "tax" of respect.
