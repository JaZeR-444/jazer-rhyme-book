# WORD: Bernacle

## Meaning (plain):
A marine crustacean (barnacle) that permanently attaches itself to a submerged surface (like a rock or ship's hull) and filter-feeds. Known for being extremely difficult to remove.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for an immovable, stubborn presence in the game. Represents someone who has attached themselves to the "hull" of the culture and can't be scraped off—a permanent fixture that feeds off the environment.
