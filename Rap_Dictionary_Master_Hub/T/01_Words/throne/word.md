# WORD: Throne

## Meaning (plain):
The ceremonial seat of state for a monarch or exalted person; the position and power of a sovereign.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate metaphor for being "#1." Sitting on the "throne" means you are the undisputed king of the game—the highest possible level of status and power. It's the goal of every hustle, but there's only room for one at the top. To take the throne is to conquer the whole culture.
