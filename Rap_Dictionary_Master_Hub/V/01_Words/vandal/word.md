# WORD: Vandal

## Meaning (plain):
A person who deliberately destroys or damages public or private property; historically, a member of a Germanic people who sacked Rome in 455 AD.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "street artist" who marks the game with their presence—deliberately disrupting the common order to leave a lasting signature. Being a "vandal" means you're not afraid to "tag" the industry with your raw energy, sacking the "Rome" of the mainstream to build your own empire.
