# WORD: Toddler

## Meaning (plain):
A young child, typically between one and three years old, who is learning to walk unsteadily.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "rookie" who is still learning to find their footing in the game. Represents someone who is taking their first unsteady steps into the streets or the industry—lacking the balance and strength of a veteran. A status of being brand new and potentially vulnerable.
