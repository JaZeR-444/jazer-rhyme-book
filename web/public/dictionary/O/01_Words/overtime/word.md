# WORD: Overtime

## Meaning (plain):
Time worked by an employee exceeding normal scheduled hours; the pay for this time; an extra period of play in a game to determine a winner.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "extra hustle." Represents the hours you put in when the rest of the game is sleeping—the 24/7 grind that separates the pros from the amateurs. When you work "overtime," you're not just doing the job; you're going for the final win.
