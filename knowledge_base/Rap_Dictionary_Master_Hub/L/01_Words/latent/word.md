# WORD: Latent

## Meaning (plain):
Existing but not yet developed or manifest; hidden or concealed; (medicine) present but not producing visible symptoms.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "hidden power" or potential that hasn't been unleashed yet. Represents someone who is a "sleeper" in the game—carrying a massive talent or a dangerous secret that is waiting for the right moment to emerge and take over.
