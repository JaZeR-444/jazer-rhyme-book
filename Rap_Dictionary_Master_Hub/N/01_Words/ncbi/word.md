# WORD: NCBI

## Meaning (plain):
The National Center for Biotechnology Information; a resource for molecular biology, providing access to biomedical and genomic information.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having the "technical DNA" of the game. Being "NCBI" means you have access to the deep secrets and the "genomic" structure of rap—you understand the science of the craft at a molecular level. A status of high-end intelligence and research.
