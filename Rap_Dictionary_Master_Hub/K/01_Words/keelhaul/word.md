# WORD: Keelhaul

## Meaning (plain):
1. A severe naval punishment in which an offender is hauled under the bottom of a ship from one side to the other. 2. To rebuke or reprimand someone severely.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate term for a "verbal thrashing." Represents a punishment that drags the competition through the "depths" and leaves them scarred. A move that is both physically and mentally devastating.
