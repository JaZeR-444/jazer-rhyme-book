# WORD: Truth

## Meaning (plain):
The quality or state of being true; that which is in accordance with fact or reality; a fact or belief that is accepted as true.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate currency in the booth. Represents raw authenticity and the "real" facts of the street that can't be faked. When you speak the truth, your bars have an unshakeable weight—they are facts that the listener feels in their gut. Being "true" means your word is bond.
