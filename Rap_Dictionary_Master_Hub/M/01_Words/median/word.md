## Meaning (plain):
The value separating the higher half from the lower half of a data sample; the "middle" value when numbers are listed in order.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "right in the middle" of the game—neither the top nor the bottom. Used to describe someone who is "average" or "intermediate." It's the balance point of the scene where the common rappers reside.
