# WORD: Thein

## Meaning (plain):
1. (Chemistry) Caffeine found in tea (theine). 2. (Archaic) A variant of "thane," a noble who held land by military service to a king.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "high-energy" and "alert" in the game. Represents someone who has that caffeinated spark and the noble status of a "thane"—holding their territory through military-like street service. A mix of energy and authority.
