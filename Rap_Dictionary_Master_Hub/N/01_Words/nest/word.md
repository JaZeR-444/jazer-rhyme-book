A structure built by animals for their eggs and young; a cozy or secluded retreat; a place where something undesirable flourishes (like a nest of thieves).

Metaphor for your "home base" or a well-guarded hideout. Represents a private space where you nurture your ideas and gather your crew away from the public eye. A "nest" can also be where the "thieves" (your loyal squad) plan their next heist.
