# WORD: Abstract

## Meaning (plain):
Existing in thought or as an idea but not having a physical or concrete existence; difficult to understand; a summary of a longer publication.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a flow that is conceptual and "out there"—hard for the average listener to grasp but deep with meaning. Represents being "apart from" the mainstream and moving in a purely intellectual or artistic space.
