# WORD: Nelson

## Meaning (plain):
(Sports) A wrestling hold in which pressure is applied to an opponent's head, neck, and arms from behind (Full Nelson, Half Nelson).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having an "unbreakable hold" on the competition. When you put the game in a "nelson," you've immobilized the rivals and applied enough pressure to force a surrender. A move of total dominance and physical control.
