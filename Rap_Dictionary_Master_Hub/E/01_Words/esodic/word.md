# WORD: Esodic

## Meaning (plain):
(Physiology) Conveying nervous impulses from the periphery of the body toward the central nervous system (specifically the spinal cord); afferent.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being highly receptive to the environment or "feeling everything" from the streets. Represents a deep, inward-flowing intuition that processes outside pressure into a central core of strength.
