# WORD: Oceania

## Meaning (plain):
The collective name for the islands throughout the Pacific Ocean; the smallest continent in land area, including Australasia and Polynesia.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for an "island-hopping" success or a territory that is vast but spread out. Represents someone who dominates multiple "islands" (lanes/scenes) across the Pacific-sized industry. A status that is geographically diverse and self-contained.
