# WORD: Meddle

## Meaning (plain):
To interfere officiously or annoyingly in matters that are not one's concern; to intrude in other people's affairs unwantedly.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "disrupting" a rival's business or for being the one who gets in the way of fakes. Represents an annoying but powerful intrusion into the "affairs" of those who think they own the lane. When you meddle, you break their flow.
