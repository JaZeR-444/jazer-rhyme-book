# WORD: Venom

## Meaning (plain):
A poisonous fluid secreted by animals (like snakes or scorpions) and injected into prey or enemies by biting or stinging; extreme malice or bitterness.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate term for "lethal lyrics." Having "venom" means your bars are poisonous to the fakes—injected with enough malice and truth to end a career with a single bite. Represents a high-intensity, acidic flow that destroys anything it touches.
