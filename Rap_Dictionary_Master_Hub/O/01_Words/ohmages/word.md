# WORD: Ohmages

## Meaning (plain):
Plural of ohmage; the amount of electrical resistance measured in ohms.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the literal "resistance" you face when you're trying to flow. Represents the "pushback" from the industry and the rivals that tries to dampen your current. High ohmages means you have to push harder to get the power through the line.
