# WORD: Zeroeth

## Meaning (plain):
An ordinal number corresponding to zero (zeroth); preceding the first in a series; used often in computer science or thermodynamics.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Representing the "pre-first" stage, being the very foundation that precedes everyone else, or having a "base-level" priority.

## Syllables:
2 (ze-ro-eth)

## Antonyms:

## Rhyme ideas (end / slant / multi):

## 3 bar-ready examples:
1. I'm on that Zeroeth law, the fundamental part.
2. Preceding the first, I'm the Zeroeth heart.
3. Foundation is deeper, call it Zeroeth.
