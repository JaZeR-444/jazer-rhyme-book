# WORD: Jinns

Supernatural beings in Islamic and Arabian mythology, made of "smokeless fire." They are unseen by humans, can change form, and possess extraordinary powers.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having "unseen" or supernatural powers in the booth. Represents someone whose energy is like "smokeless fire"—intense, hidden, and capable of shifting forms to fit any beat. A force that exists in the shadows but controls everything.
