# WORD: Territory

## Meaning (plain):
A geographic area under the jurisdiction of an authority; an area that is occupied and defended by an animal or person; a field of knowledge.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "hood" or the specific "lane" you own in the game. Having "territory" means you have unshakeable dominance over a certain part of the culture—you defend it from invaders and you rule it with absolute authority. It's your home base and your power center.
