# 📊 JaZeR Rhyme Book - Complete File Review Report

**Date:** 2026-01-20  
**Reviewer:** GitHub Copilot CLI (Senior Front-End Engineer & QA)  
**Build Status:** ✅ Passing

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

All 62 files in the `/web` directory were reviewed for:
- Syntax errors and broken imports
- Invalid routes and navigation
- CSS issues and mobile responsiveness
- Accessibility basics (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
- Performance concerns

**Overall Assessment:** The codebase is well-structured with good separation of concerns. A few broken routes were identified and fixed.

---

## 🔧 Issues Found & Fixed

### 1. Broken Route: `/workspace` (3 files affected)

**Problem:** Multiple components referenced a `/workspace` route that doesn't exist in the router.

**Files Fixed:**

| File | Line | Change |
|------|------|--------|
| `src/components/mobile/MobileNavigation.jsx` | 13 | Replaced `/workspace` with `/studio` and `/search` |
| `src/components/mobile/MobileHeader.jsx` | 47 | Replaced `/workspace` link with `/search` |
| `src/components/command/NaturalLanguageParser.js` | 179 | Replaced `workspace: '/workspace'` with `search: '/search'` |

**Reason:** The Workspace is implemented as a drawer (`WorkspaceDrawer.jsx`), not a separate page route.

## ✅ Validation Results

### Build Verification
```
Command: npm run build
Result: ✓ built in 58.66s
Exit Code: 0
```

### Dependency Installation
```
Command: npm install --legacy-peer-deps
Result: Success
Note: react-window has peer dep conflict with React 19 (requires --legacy-peer-deps)
```

### Lint Check
```
Command: npm run lint
Result: ESLint 9 requires eslint.config.js (flat config)
Note: No eslint.config.js present - lint script exists but needs config file
```

## 📁 Files Reviewed by Category

### Core Application Files (8 files) ✅
- `src/App.jsx` - Error boundaries, lazy loading, proper routing
- `src/main.jsx` - StrictMode enabled, error handling
- `src/index.css` - CSS variables, reduced motion, dark mode
- `index.html` - SEO meta tags, OG tags, font preloads
- `vite.config.js` / `scripts/vite.config.js` - Chunk splitting, compression
- `package.json` - Valid dependencies and scripts
- `.gitignore` - Standard Node/Vite patterns

### UI Components (15+ files) ✅

## 🚨 Remaining Risks & TODOs

### Low Risk
1. **ESLint Config Missing** - Add `eslint.config.js` for ESLint 9 flat config
2. **Peer Dependency Warning** - `react-window` needs update for React 19

### Future Improvements (Not Blockers)
1. Add PWA manifest for offline support
2. Consider Sentry/error tracking integration
3. Add E2E tests with Playwright
4. Performance: Main bundle is 2.1MB (gzip: 659KB) - consider further code splitting
