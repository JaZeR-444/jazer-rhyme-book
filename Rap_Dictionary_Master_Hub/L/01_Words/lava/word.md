# WORD: Lava

## Meaning (plain):
Molten or partially molten rock (magma) expelled from the interior of a planet onto its surface; solid rock formed by the cooling of such material.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate metaphor for a flow that is molten hot and unstoppable. Represents a high-intensity, destructive energy that buries the competition and hardens into a permanent monument. If the bars are "lava," they're at the highest possible temperature.
