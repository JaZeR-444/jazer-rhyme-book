# WORD: OG

## Meaning (plain):
(Slang) "Original Gangster"; someone who is incredibly exceptional, authentic, or old-school; a long-time member of a gang or group.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate term for "veteran" status and original authenticity. Being an "OG" means you've been in the game since the beginning and have earned the respect of everyone who followed. Represents someone whose roots are deep and whose influence is the foundation of the culture.
