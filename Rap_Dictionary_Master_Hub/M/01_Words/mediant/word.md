# WORD: Mediant

## Meaning (plain):
(Music Theory) The third tone or degree of a major or minor musical scale, located halfway between the tonic and the dominant.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being the "bridging" energy in a movement or a track. Represents a flow that sits between the foundational "tonic" (the root) and the powerful "dominant" (the peak). A crucial, intermediate note that completes the harmony.
