# WORD: Orbitz

## Meaning (plain):
(Brand/Name) A travel company; (Slang/Unique) A state of high-traffic or widespread movement; to move in an orbit or circle around a core.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having a "high-traffic" and global presence. Being "Orbitz" means you're always moving, traveling between levels of the game, and maintaining a high-visibility "orbit" around the center of the culture. A status of constant, circular dominance.
