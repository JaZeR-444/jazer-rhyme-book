# WORD: Trailing

## Meaning (plain):
1. (Sports) In a position behind or losing in a competition. 2. Following behind or pulled behind. 3. (Botany) Having a long stem that spreads over the ground.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a rival who is "losing the race." Being "trailing" means you're not at the front of the pack—you're following in the dust of the real leaders. Also refers to a flow that is "loose" and spreading too thin—lacking the tightness of a winner.
