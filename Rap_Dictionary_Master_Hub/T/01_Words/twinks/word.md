# WORD: Twinks

## Meaning (plain):
1. (Slang) A young, attractive, and slender man. 2. (Archaic) To twinkle or wink.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "youthful" but unweighted presence. Used to describe someone who has the "look" but lacks the heavy street weight or the "muscle" of a veteran. A status of being bright and attractive but potentially easier to move or dismiss.
