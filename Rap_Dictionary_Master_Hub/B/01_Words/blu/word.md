# WORD: Blu

## Meaning (plain):
The Italian word for the color "blue." It can also carry connotations of sadness, unripeness (for fruit), or indecency/riskiness depending on context.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "sad" but cool intensity or for being "unripe" (raw and untested) but high-potential. Represents a "blue" mood that is deep, ocean-like, and slightly risky.
