# WORD: Triers

## Meaning (plain):
1. People who make a strong effort to succeed, even if not initially successful. 2. Implements used for taking samples of bulk material (like a tapered tube). 3. Someone who tests or attempts something.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "grinders" who never stop attempting the win. Represents someone who might not have reached the top yet but who gives 100% effort every time. Also refers to those who "sample" the game—constantly testing new flows and taking pieces of the culture to build their own.
