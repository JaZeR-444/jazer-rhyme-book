# WORD: Xylene

## Meaning (plain):
Any of three organic compounds (colorless, flammable, greasy liquids) of great industrial value, used as a solvent and in the manufacture of dyes and perfumes.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being the "industrial solvent" of the game. Being "xylene" means your presence dissolves the fakes and clears the path for the new era. Represents a high-value, "greasy" (smooth but flammable) energy that fuels the production of hit records and powerful images.
