# WORD: Failsoft

## Meaning (plain):
Pertaining to a system designed to continue operating, even if at a reduced capacity, after a partial failure (graceful degradation).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "unbreakable" even when things go wrong. Represents a persona or system that doesn't collapse under pressure—even if you take a hit, you keep moving and "gracefully" maintain control.
