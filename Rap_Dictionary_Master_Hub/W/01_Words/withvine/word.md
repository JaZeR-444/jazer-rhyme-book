# WORD: Withvine

## Meaning (plain):
A local name for couch-grass (Elymus repens), known for its deep, spreading roots and difficulty to eradicate.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "unshakeable persistence" and having roots that go too deep to pull. Being a "withvine" in the game means you've spread your influence so far through the soil of the culture that the fakes can't get rid of you—you're an invasive, permanent strength.
