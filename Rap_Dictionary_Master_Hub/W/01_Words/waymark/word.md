# WORD: Waymark

## Meaning (plain):
A sign or symbol marked in a prominent position to show the track of a footpath or route; a guidepost or milestone.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being a "living milestone" in the game. Represents a track, a move, or a person that acts as a guide for everyone else—showing the path through the uncharted wilderness of the industry. Being a waymark means your success is a visible sign that others follow.
