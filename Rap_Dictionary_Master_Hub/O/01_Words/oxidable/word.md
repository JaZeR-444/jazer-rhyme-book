# WORD: Oxidable

## Meaning (plain):
Capable of undergoing oxidation or being converted into an oxide (reacting with oxygen).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for someone who is "reactive" and ready to ignite. Represents a talent that has the potential to "catch fire" the moment it hits the open air of the streets. Being "oxidable" means you're waiting for the spark to turn you into a legend.
