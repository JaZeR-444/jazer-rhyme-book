# WORD: Infinite

## Meaning (plain):
Limitless or endless in space, extent, or size; impossible to measure or calculate.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having "unending" talent and potential. Represents a flow that never runs out of bars and a status that is boundless. To be infinite is to be immeasurable—someone whose influence stretches beyond the limits of the game.
