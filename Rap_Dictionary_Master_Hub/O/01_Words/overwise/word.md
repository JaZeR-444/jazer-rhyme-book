# WORD: Overwise

## Meaning (plain):
Excessively or unusually wise; too clever for one's own good; pretentiously wise.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "too smart" for the common listener or for a rival who thinks they're a genius but actually just complicates things. Represents a status where your "wisdom" has become a hindrance—being so clever that you lose the raw energy of the street. A mark of pretension.
