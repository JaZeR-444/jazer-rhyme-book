# WORD: Naturally

## Meaning (plain):
In a natural or normal manner; by nature or inherent character; without artificial aid or intervention; as might be expected.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for "effortless" excellence. Represents someone who doesn't need to try too hard to be the best—their talent is inherent and unforced. When you move "naturally," you're in perfect sync with your own nature and the rhythm of the streets.
