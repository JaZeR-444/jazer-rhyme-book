# WORD: Unanimous

## Meaning (plain):
Of one mind; in complete agreement; agreed to by everyone.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for having "undisputed" support. Being "unanimous" means there's no debate—the streets, the blogs, and the rivals all agree that you're the one. A status of total, one-mind acceptance where everyone gives you your props.
