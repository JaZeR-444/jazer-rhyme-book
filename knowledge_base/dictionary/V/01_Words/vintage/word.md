# WORD: Vintage

## Meaning (plain):
The year or place in which wine, especially high-quality wine, was produced; of high quality and from a past era (classic).

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "classic" and high-end sound that only gets better with age. Being "vintage" means your style has timeless value and carries the prestige of a legendary era. Represents someone whose flow is like a rare, bottled success—highly sought after and expensive.
