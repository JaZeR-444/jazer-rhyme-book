# WORD: Thraso

## Meaning (plain):
(Greek Mythology) The personified spirit (daimon) of rashness, insolence, recklessness, and excessive boldness.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for an "unshakeable boldness" and aggressive insolence. Represents someone who doesn't care about the rules or the feelings of the fakes—they move with a reckless, excessive confidence that is both terrifying and powerful. A "daimon" of the street.
