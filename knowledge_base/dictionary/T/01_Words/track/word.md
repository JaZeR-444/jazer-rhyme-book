# WORD: Track

## Meaning (plain):
A mark left on a surface; a path, road, or course; one of the songs on a recording; to follow or plot a moving path.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for the "path to success" and the individual pieces of work that build it. Being "on track" means you're following your strategic route to the top. Each "track" (song) is a milestone on that road—a literal record of your journey through the struggle.
