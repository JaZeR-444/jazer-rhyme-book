# WORD: Widowman

## Meaning (plain):
(Archaic/Dialectal) A widower; a man whose wife has died and who has not remarried.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for a "lone survivor" in the game. Represents someone who lost their partner, their crew, or their "other half" but stayed in the booth—running the streets solo and carrying the weight of what was lost. A status of dark, independent resilience.
