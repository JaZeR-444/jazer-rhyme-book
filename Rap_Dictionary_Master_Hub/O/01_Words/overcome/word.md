# WORD: Overcome

## Meaning (plain):
To get the better of in a struggle or conflict; to conquer or defeat; to prevail over difficulties or be overwhelmed by something.

Metaphor for the "ultimate victory" over the struggle. Represents someone who has faced the hardest obstacles and come out on top—conquering the streets and the industry alike. Being "overcome" by your own talent means the flow is so strong it overwhelms you.
