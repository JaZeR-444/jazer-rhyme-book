# WORD: Zenith

## Meaning (plain):
The point in the sky directly above an observer; the highest point reached by a celestial body; the time at which something is most powerful or successful.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
The ultimate metaphor for being at your "absolute peak." When you're at the zenith, you're looking down on the whole game from the highest possible point—your power and success are at their maximum level. A status of celestial-level dominance.
