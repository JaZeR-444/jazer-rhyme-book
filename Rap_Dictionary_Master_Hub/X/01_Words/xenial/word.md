# WORD: Xenial

## Meaning (plain):
Hospitable, especially to visiting strangers or foreigners; relating to the friendly relationship between a host and guest.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being the "ultimate host" of the culture. Being "xenial" means you welcome the real talent into your movement, creating a network of high-status "guests" and allies. It's about being hospitable to the right ones while keeping the fakes at the door.
