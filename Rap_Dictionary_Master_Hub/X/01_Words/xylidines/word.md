# WORD: Xylidines

## Meaning (plain):
Any of six poisonous liquid or crystalline isomeric compounds derived from xylene, used in dye manufacture and organic synthesis.

Metaphor for having a "lethal variety" of influences. Being "xylidines" means your flow can take many poisonous forms (isomers), each one capable of dyeing the game with a different high-intensity color. Represents a toxic, chemically-refined talent that creates a permanent mark.
