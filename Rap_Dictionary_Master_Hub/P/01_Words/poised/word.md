# WORD: Poised

## Meaning (plain):
Having a composed and self-assured manner; balanced; ready for action.

## Rap meaning (how I'd say it):
Metaphor for being "perfectly ready" to strike. Represents the calm before the storm—someone who is so balanced and assured that they don't need to rush. When you're poised, your aim is true and your presence is unshakeable.
